Modeling - Relationship lines --> example 1 to * ... * means many so translated is 1 to many

1 means a unique row for the dimension (ex: product key)

What the arrow direction means:

Any filter that I apply on the product table or on the customer table, is going to flow across the relationship

Example: A filter applied on the category name is going to flow across the relationship

1 to many and many to 1 are the same thing as depends on the order the tables are placed- terminology is defined as cardinality

Different types of cardinality:

Many to one --> *:1
One to one --> 1:1
One to many --> 1:*
Many to many --> *:*

One to one is unusual

Many to many is when you create a relationship between two tables and neither of them have a unique column (repeating values like region)


Recommendation: Until you know how to use many to many relationships... don't use it

Note: The direction (relationship) should always be single (single direction) direction to (-->) fact

	There is another direction which is for both sides (avoid)

	The single and double (both) arrow are classified under cross filter direction

Data Model example: see word document of same name
