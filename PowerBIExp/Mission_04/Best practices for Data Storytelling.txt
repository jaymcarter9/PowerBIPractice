Leo's Recommendations:

1. Be concerned about design.
2. Identify your audience. Who are the people who will consume your dashboard? Different audiences will want to see different information.
3. Draw a sketch
4. Choose the right theme, colors, pallette. Be consistent.
5. Backgrounds - The background will provide the wow effect
6. Use icons/images. Website to download for free. Icons and images add context
7. Align everythign correctly
8. Use the right visuals. Example: If i want to compare categories with other categories - what is the best visual. And for comparisons over time?
9. Use/understand all features inside Power BI


Do's Don'ts Graphic:
Dos: Show in context --> rank data in a relevant way so patterns and outliers become visible.
Don't: Misleading design --> a truncated axis in a column or bar-chart distorts the relative size of the columns
Do: Target or benchmark --> Enrich your chart with target or benchmarks, to give the values more meaning.
